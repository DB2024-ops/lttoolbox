lttoolbox
===============================================================================

lttoolbox contains finite state tools for lexical processing,
morphological analysis and generation of words. Analysis is the
process of splitting a word like `cats` into its lemma `cat` and the
grammatical information `<n><pl>`. Generation is the opposite process.

The three programs main programs are lt-comp, the compiler, lt-proc,
the processor, and lt-expand, which generates all possible mappings
between surface forms and lexical forms in the dictionary.

Executables built by this package:

* `lt-comp`: compiler, execute without parameters to show usage
  instructions.

* `lt-proc`: processor, typical options are -a (lexical analyser,
  default option), -g (lexical generator) and -p (lexical
  post-generator). Using -h will show all flags.

* `lt-expand`: generates all the pairs of transductions of a given
  dictionary. Execute without parameters to show the instructions of
  use.

* `lt-trim`: trims a compiled analyser to only contain entries which
  would pass through a compiled bidix, creating a new compiled and
  trimmed analyser.

* `lt-print`: print the arcs of a transducer in [ATT format][3].

There is also a C++ API that you can link to (see how [apertium][1] or
[apertium-lex-tools][2] do this).

See https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Lttoolbox for usage examples and
more information.
